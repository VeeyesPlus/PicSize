# PicSize
PicSize provides a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for resizing images from an input folder to the specified dimensions while preserving the original aspect ratio and resolution (DPI). The program uses the tkinter library for creating the graphical interface and the PIL (Pillow) library for image processing.
